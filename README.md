# Software-Projects
In my second year of computer science, I did a module called 'Software Projects'. I had to work in a group of 6. We had to plan and develop software. We created two applications: Service requester and Contractor applications. These applications were developed to handle the issue of the ever rising self employment level. It took an uber-styled approach to service requesting.

Check the Labora Service Requester and Labora Contractor repositories for code respectively.
